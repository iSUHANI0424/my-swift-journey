Went to the park today after more than two months since the first surgery , it felt refreshing. Started with tutorials on swift from Hacking with Swift and had an idea of my first ios app. Will share the designs soon. More tomorrow.(i know these journals aren't really that long or describable about anything but that's because i get tired by the time i go to bed and i do my journaling before going to bed, will improve that soon )
