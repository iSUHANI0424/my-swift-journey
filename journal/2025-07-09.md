Day 5 
Had a really long time at the hospital. Got one cardiac consultatiom after waiting for 2 hours then got my stitches removed , then had to wait for over 5 hours to get the first cardiac consultation reviewed by their senior . Hospitals do lack staff...like their senior waas being called so many times for every emergency case that would come up today and then other doctors and surgeons would rush too...
so more tomorrow...although my friends would come tomorrow to celebrate my birthday...belated birthday cause i was hospitalised during my birthday and then...just never got time to celebrate it....ill try to study some lessons today...and no, they don't tire me at all...last night i found myself awake watching a video of the first htc mobile unboxing🫠😁
