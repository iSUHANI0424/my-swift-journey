#Personal reflection:-
  -Well first of all, i can't even begin with how interesting this machine is and we take it for granted so many times
  -If this is what the core is , i can't even imagine what its tributaries would look like in the future.
  -Its as if every step we have taken in history of making computers and systems and are making it on our way, it has served as and serves as a foundation for new one.
